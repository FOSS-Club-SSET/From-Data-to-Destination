## OSM Mapathon  

An **OSM Mapathon** is a coordinated event conducted by the local OSM community where participants collaborate to improve mapping data. These events aim to:  

- Introduce new contributors to OSM.  
- Improve map accuracy and detail.  
- Provide critical mapping data during disasters for better insights into affected regions.

## Tips for Effective Mapping  

1. **Start Local**: Map areas you know well.  
2. **Use Satellite Images**: Cross-check with imagery from Bing or Mapbox.  
3. **On-Ground Surveys**: Walk around to gather missing data. ([Use OSM Tracker](https://youtu.be/bIRGXkmhw5k)) 
4. **Tag Properly**: Add details like names, hours, or descriptions. 
Refer: [OSM Good Practices](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)

## Criteria for the Best Mappers  

- **Contributions**: Total edits (e.g., buildings and roads added).  
- **Quality**: Accuracy and completeness of data.  
- **Diversity**: A mix of mapped features (e.g., roads, POIs, green spaces).
- **Impact**: Contributions to critical or under-mapped areas.  
Refer: [OSM Good Practices](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)
