# OpenStreetMap (OSM) Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the **OpenStreetMap (OSM) Beginner's Guide**! This guide introduces OSM and provides step-by-step instructions for new mappers.

## What is OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap is a collaborative platform where users can contribute geographical data. Itâ€™s widely used for navigation, research, and humanitarian efforts. Contributors add data using GPS devices, aerial images, and on-ground surveys.

## OSM Mapathon

An **OSM Mapathon** is a coordinated event conducted by the local OSM community where participants collaborate to improve mapping data. These events are designed to:

- Introduce new contributors to OSM.
- Improve map accuracy and detail.
- Provide critical mapping data during disasters to gain better insights into affected regions.
